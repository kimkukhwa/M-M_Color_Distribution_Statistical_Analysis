# M&M_Color_Distribution_Statistical_Analysis
This project is to review the fundamentals of statistical hypothesis testing. While googling around to find real-life sample datasets, I stumbled into the cool website of Josh Madison (https://joshmadison.com/about/). It seems like he experimented with 48 packages of M&M and compiled each pack's color distribution results in 2007. That's amazing! I will replicate some of his analysis + I will include some hypothesis testing.
